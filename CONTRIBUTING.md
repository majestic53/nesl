## Places to Contribute

### Bug-fixes in existing code

This project is a currently a work-in-progress. Some features may not be completed or may be buggy. Any bug fixes in existing code would be greatly appreciated.

### Adding additional mapper support

This project only implements a few of the common mappers the original NES supported. Adding more mappers will increase the number of games supported.
* For a full list of possible mappers, see the [NESDEV wiki](https://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=Mapper).

### Adding undocumented instruction support

This project only implements the official documented instructions in the processor. A few games take advantage of undocumented instructions, and are not currently supported.
* For a list of undocumented instructions, see the [NESDEV wiki](https://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php?title=CPU_unofficial_opcodes).
